# Interactive Prototyping: The Clock of Pi
Yoyo Wang - hw867

Does it feel like time is moving strangely during this semester?

For our first Pi project, we will pay homage to the [timekeeping devices of old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_timekeeping_devices) by making simple clocks.

It is worth spending a little time thinking about how you mark time, and what would be useful in a clock of your own design.

**Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab here.**
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 

## Prep

Lab Prep is extra long this week. Make sure to start this early for lab on Thursday.

1. ### Set up your Lab 2 Github

Before the start of lab Thursday, ensure you have the latest lab content by updating your forked repository. 

**📖 [Follow the step-by-step guide for safely updating your fork](pull_updates/README.md)**

This guide covers how to pull updates without overwriting your completed work, handle merge conflicts, and recover if something goes wrong.


2. ### Get Kit and Inventory Parts
Prior to the lab session on Thursday, taken inventory of the kit parts that you have, and note anything that is missing:

***Update your [parts list inventory](partslist.md)***

3. ### Prepare your Pi for lab this week
[Follow these instructions](prep.md) to download and burn the image for your Raspberry Pi before lab Thursday.

## The Report
This readme.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done. You can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the \*\*\***stars**\*\*\*. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in the readme.

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. 
### Connect to your Pi
Just like you did in the lab prep, ssh on to your pi. Once you get there, create a Python environment (named venv) by typing the following commands.

```
ssh pi@<your Pi's IP address>
...
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python -m venv venv
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ 

```
### Setup Personal Access Tokens on GitHub
Set your git name and email so that commits appear under your name.
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "yourNetID@cornell.edu"
```

The support for password authentication of GitHub was removed on August 13, 2021. That is, in order to link and sync your own lab-hub repo with your Pi, you will have to set up a "Personal Access Tokens" to act as the password for your GitHub account on your Pi when using git command, such as `git clone` and `git push`.

Following the steps listed [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) from GitHub to set up a token. Depends on your preference, you can set up and select the scopes, or permissions, you would like to grant the token. This token will act as your GitHub password later when you use the terminal on your Pi to sync files with your lab-hub repo.


## Part B. 
### Try out the Command Line Clock
Clone your own lab-hub repo for this assignment to your Pi and change the directory to Lab 2 folder (remember to replace the following command line with your own GitHub ID):

```
(venv) pi@raspberrypi:~$ git clone https://github.com/<YOURGITID>/Interactive-Lab-Hub.git
(venv) pi@raspberrypi:~$ cd Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab\ 2/
```
Depends on the setting, you might be asked to provide your GitHub user name and password. Remember to use the "Personal Access Tokens" you just set up as the password instead of your account one!

Check if the directory has clone sucessfully, you should see the Interactive-Lab-Hub under the home directory listed:
```
(venv) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls
Bookshelf      Documents            Music     Public                 venv
create_img.sh  Downloads            pi-apps   screen_boot_script.py  Videos
Desktop        Interactive-Lab-Hub  Pictures  Templates
(venv) pi@raspberrypi:~ $
```


Install the packages from the requirements.txt and run the example script `cli_clock.py`:

```
(venv) pi@raspberrypi:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 2 $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(venv) pi@raspberrypi:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 2 $ python cli_clock.py 
02/24/2021 11:20:49
```

The terminal should show the time, you can press `ctrl-c` to exit the script.
If you are unfamiliar with the Python code in `cli_clock.py`, have a look at [this Python refresher](https://hackernoon.com/intermediate-python-refresher-tutorial-project-ideas-and-tips-i28s320p). If you are still concerned, please reach out to the teaching staff!


## Part C. 
### Set up your RGB Display
We have asked you to equip the [Adafruit MiniPiTFT](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4393) on your Pi in the Lab 2 prep already. Here, we will introduce you to the MiniPiTFT and Python scripts on the Pi with more details.

<img src="https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/082/842/large1024/adafruit_products_4393_iso_ORIG_2019_10.jpg" height="200" />

The Raspberry Pi 4 has a variety of interfacing options. When you plug the pi in the red power LED turns on. Any time the SD card is accessed the green LED flashes. It has standard USB ports and HDMI ports. Less familiar it has a set of 20x2 pin headers that allow you to connect a various peripherals.

To learn more about any individual pin and what it is for go to [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/3v3_power) and click on the pin. Some terms may be unfamiliar but we will go over the relevant ones as they come up.

### Hardware (you have already done this in the prep)

From your kit take out the display and the [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.raspberrypi.com%2Fproducts%2Fraspberry-pi-5%2F&psig=AOvVaw330s4wIQWfHou2Vk3-0jUN&ust=1757611779758000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBMQjRxqFwoTCPi1-5_czo8DFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE)

Line up the screen and press it on the headers. The hole in the screen should match up with the hole on the raspberry pi.

</p>

### Testing your Screen

The display uses a communication protocol called [SPI](https://www.circuitbasics.com/basics-of-the-spi-communication-protocol/) to speak with the raspberry pi. We won't go in depth in this course over how SPI works. The port on the bottom of the display connects to the SDA and SCL pins used for the I2C communication protocol which we will cover later. GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins 23 and 24 are connected to the two buttons on the left. GPIO 22 controls the display backlight.

To show you the IP and Mac address of the Pi to allow connecting remotely we created a service that launches a python script that runs on boot. For the following steps stop the service by typing ``` sudo systemctl stop piscreen.service --now```. Othwerise two scripts will try to use the screen at once. You may start it again by typing ``` sudo systemctl start piscreen.service --now```

We can test it by typing 
```
(venv) pi@raspberrypi:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 2 $ python screen_test.py
```

You can type the name of a color then press either of the buttons on the MiniPiTFT to see what happens on the display! You can press `ctrl-c` to exit the script. Take a look at the code with
```
(venv) pi@raspberrypi:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 2 $ cat screen_test.py
```

#### Displaying Info with Texts
You can look in `screen_boot_script.py` for how to display text on the screen!

#### Displaying an image

You can look in `image.py` for an example of how to display an image on the screen. Can you make it switch to another image when you push one of the buttons?

# Prep for Part 2

**Comments from Peers**:

"Your design demonstrates a fresh and creative approach, showing that you were able to expand ideas thoughtfully and explore the design space with originality. The technical execution is solid and well-developed, with the demonstration clearly illustrating the concept’s functionality and value. In addition, your documentation is very clear and well-structured, making the process and outcomes easy to follow and understand. The only area for further improvement is the user testing, where adding more detailed feedback and your own reflections would make the overall work even stronger and more convincing."          
———Sirui Wang

"I recently came across a psychology idea that struck me: instead of the common belief that emotions shape our state, it’s actually the other way around—our state comes first, and emotions follow. The challenge is that when we look back on our recent states, it’s often hard to recall the details, which makes it difficult to understand what caused the fluctuations or how to adjust. With this mood clock, I can build the habit of recording my emotional state in the moment. That way, it becomes much easier to diagnose and fine-tune my state whenever I need to."

# Lab 2 Part 2

## Assignment that was formerly Lab 2 Part E.
### Modify the barebones clock to make it your own
clock assignment code: [game-clock.py](./game-clock.py)

![Verplank diagram](Verplank_diagram.png)

Does time have to be linear?  How do you measure a year? [In daylights? In midnights? In cups of coffee?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsj15wPpjLY)

Can you make time interactive? You can look in `screen_test.py` for examples for how to use the buttons.

Please sketch/diagram your clock idea. (Try using a [Verplank diagram](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/250a-fall-2004/IDSketchbok.pdf))!

**We strongly discourage and will reject the results of literal digital or analog clock display.**
